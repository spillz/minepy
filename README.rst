A fork of fogleman's simple Minecraft-inspired demo (https://github.com/fogleman/minecraft) written in 
Python.

Limitations of the Master Branch
--------------------------------

1. When moving around you will see framerate drops because terrain generation slows down the drawing speed 
   due to python's Global Interpreter Lock. Check out the server branch, which works around this problem by 
   using a background process instead of a thread. 
2. Lighting is very simple, no shadows or dark areas of the terrain yet. The server branch has some basic 
   lighting implemented but it is far from compelete and doesn't propagate across sectors.
3. Nothing is saved. The server branch uses a level DB database to store world changes.

Technical
---------

Uses pyglet to render the graphics and numpy for its powerful and fast array processing. 
Has much better performance than fogleman's original version and world size is unlimited.

Currently uses minecraft style textures and you can easily add new block types. Take a look at blocks.py

Take a look at config.py for some configuration options, such as draw distance. 

How to Run
==========

    pip install pyglet
    pip install numpy
    git clone https://github.com/spillz/minepy.git
    cd minepy
    python main.py

Alternatively, to try the server branch you will need to get leveldb and checkout the server branch:

    pip install leveldb
    git checkout -b server

You can run it standalone:
    
    python main.py
    
Or try a server with one or more clients:

   python server
   
To get 2 clients running on the same machine, open a new terminal and type:

   python main.py localhost &
   python main.py localhost &

You can also connect from elsewhere on your LAN if you know the local 
IP of the PC running the server, i.e. you would run 

   python main.py <IPADDRESS>


Mac
----

On Mac OS X, you may have an issue with running Pyglet in 64-bit mode. Try running Python in 32-bit mode first:

    arch -i386 python main.py

If that doesn't work, set Python to run in 32-bit mode by default:

    defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

This assumes you are using the OS X default Python.  Works on Lion 10.7 with the default Python 2.7, and may work on other versions too.  Please raise an issue if not.

Or try Pyglet 1.2 alpha, which supports 64-bit mode:

    pip install https://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz

If you don't have pip or git
--------------------------------

For pip:

- Mac or Linux: install with `sudo easy_install pip` (Mac or Linux) - or (Linux) find a package called something like 'python-pip' in your package manager.
- Windows: [install Distribute then Pip](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379/992887) using the linked .MSI installers.

For git:

- Mac: install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) first, then `brew install git`.
- Windows or Linux: see [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) from the _Pro Git_ book.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft/wiki) for this project to install Python, and other tips.

How to Play
================

Moving

- W: forward
- S: back
- A: strafe left
- D: strafe right
- Mouse: look around
- Space: jump
- Tab: toggle flying mode

Building

Use the number keys to select the type of block to create:
    - 1: dirt with grass
    - 2: grass
    - 3: sand
    - etc
- Mouse left-click: remove block
- Mouse right-click: create block
